## Digits Recognition (manual)

Manual implementation of neural network that recognize digits from images 8x8 pixels.
Image is 8x8 array with values [0..15] representing gray level of pixel.

Launch:
```
python3 digits_recognition.py [--iterations X] [--hide-plots]
```

Parameters:
```
--iterations X - set how much iterations of training/checking should be performed (default 30)
--hide-plots   - do not show figures with pass rate and sum of square error on check (default: show)
```
